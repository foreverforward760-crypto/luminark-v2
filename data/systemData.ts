    subtitle: "The Void",
    description: "Pure potential before form. The pause before the breath.",
    fullDescription: `You are in a state of complete openness and possibility. This is the pre-creative void where all potential exists but no form has yet emerged. Like the moment before dawn, before a breath, before a thought takes shape. This stage is not emptiness—it is fullness without structure. You may feel directionless, but you are actually pregnant with infinite possibility. This is the sacred pause, the reset point, the blank canvas. Trust this moment of formlessness; it is where true transformation begins.`,
    guidance: "Rest in the void. Do not rush to fill it. Allow potential to gather."
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "PULSE",
    subtitle: "Emergence",
    description: "The first stirring of energy. Directionless but alive.",
    fullDescription: `Something is stirring within you—a subtle pulse, an unnamed energy beginning to move. You can't yet name what it is or where it's going, but you feel it. This is the first spark of life after dormancy, the first flutter of wings before flight. There's no clear direction yet, just raw aliveness. You might feel restless, curious, or slightly chaotic. This energy is not meant to be controlled or understood—only felt and allowed to build. The pulse is your life force waking up.`,
    guidance: "Follow the energy without forcing direction. Let the pulse guide you organically."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "DUALITY",
    subtitle: "The Split",
    description: "Encountering the other. Me vs You. Good vs Bad. The birth of conflict and relationship.",
    fullDescription: `You've encountered the 'other'—whether another person, an opposing idea, or an internal conflict. The world is no longer unified; it has split into opposites. This is where you learn about boundaries, differences, and tension. It can feel polarizing: us vs them, right vs wrong, desire vs fear. This stage is uncomfortable but essential—duality teaches you discernment, choice, and relationship. Without contrast, there is no growth. The key is not to collapse back into oneness prematurely, but to hold the tension and learn from it.`,
    guidance: "Embrace the tension. Don't rush to resolve it. Let opposing forces teach you."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "EXPRESSION",
    subtitle: "The Spark",
    description: "Creative chaotic breakthrough. Messy, intense, vital. The artist's chaos.",
    fullDescription: `You are in full creative explosion. Energy pours out of you—messy, chaotic, brilliant, raw. This is the artist's stage, the entrepreneur's mad dash, the lover's passion. Structure hasn't caught up with inspiration yet, and that's okay. You're breaking through old patterns, making something new, speaking your truth loudly. It may feel volatile or unstable, but this is the necessary chaos of creation. Don't judge the mess—it's the birth canal of something important. This stage is about expression without censorship.`,
    guidance: "Create without editing. Let it be messy. Refine later, express now."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "FOUNDATION",
    subtitle: "The Square",
    description: "Building structure. Routine, discipline, safety. The healthy plateau.",
    fullDescription: `You've settled into a stable pattern. Life has structure, predictability, and safety. This is the stage of building—whether that's a career, a relationship, a daily routine, or a system. You know what to expect, and that brings comfort. This is not stagnation; it's consolidation. You're integrating what you've learned and creating a solid base. The danger here is mistaking comfort for completion. Foundation is necessary, but it's a plateau, not a peak. Enjoy the stability, but stay aware that the next crisis will come—and that's by design.`,
    guidance: "Build strong foundations, but don't mistake stability for the end goal."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "THRESHOLD",
    subtitle: "The Crisis",
    description: "The point of no return. Stability fails, tension spikes. You must choose to evolve or regress.",
    fullDescription: `The structure is cracking. Something that worked before no longer works. You're at a crossroads: evolve forward into unknown territory, or retreat back to what's familiar. This is the hero's call, the dark night, the initiation. It's deeply uncomfortable—your old self is dying, and your new self hasn't fully formed yet. You might feel lost, confused, or even broken. But this is not failure—this is transformation. The threshold demands courage. You cannot stay here; you must choose.`,
    guidance: "Do not retreat. Step through the threshold even if you can't see what's on the other side."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    name: "INTEGRATION",
    subtitle: "Flow",
    description: "High performance. Everything works. Harmony between structure and flow.",
    fullDescription: `You've crossed the threshold, and now everything is clicking. You're in flow—work feels effortless, relationships feel harmonious, life has momentum. This is mastery in motion. You've integrated the lessons from previous stages, and your internal and external worlds are aligned. This is peak performance, and it feels incredible. But beware: this stage can seduce you into thinking you've 'arrived.' Flow is not permanent—it's a temporary state of grace. Enjoy it fully, but don't cling to it.`,
    guidance: "Flow with it, but don't grasp it. Integration is a gift, not a destination."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    name: "DISSOLUTION",
    subtitle: "The Alchemy",
    description: "Deep purification. Stripping away the non-essential. Painful but necessary.",
    fullDescription: `You're being refined. Everything non-essential is burning away—beliefs, identities, attachments, illusions. This is the alchemical fire, the dark night of the soul, the shedding of skins. It's painful because you're losing parts of yourself you thought were *you*. But what's dissolving are only the masks and defenses. Your essence remains. This stage strips you down to your core truth. It's not comfortable, but it's profoundly purifying. What emerges on the other side is the real you—unadorned, authentic, free.`,
    guidance: "Surrender. Let go of what no longer serves. Trust the purification process."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    name: "UNITY PEAK",
    subtitle: "The Trap",
    description: "Maximum achievement. The danger of claiming 'I Have Arrived.' Rigidity here equals death.",
    fullDescription: `You've reached the summit. Everything you've worked for is here—success, recognition, mastery, unity. You feel complete, integrated, powerful. This is the peak experience, the mountaintop, the crown. But here lies the greatest danger: the trap of permanence. If you believe this is the final stage, if you claim 'I have arrived,' you will calcify. The peak is not the end—it's just the highest point before the next descent. The universe will not let you stay here forever. Rigidity at the peak equals spiritual death. Stay humble. Stay open.`,
    guidance: "Celebrate the peak, but do not cling. Prepare to descend and begin again."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    name: "RELEASE",
    subtitle: "Transparency",
    description: "Wisdom without attachment. Leading by letting go. The return to the start.",
    fullDescription: `You've seen it all—the rise, the fall, the cycle. Now you hold wisdom without attachment. You're no longer driven by ego or fear; you simply are. This is the sage stage, the elder, the teacher who leads by letting go. You've returned to the beginning, but now with full consciousness. You can guide others without controlling them. You can create without attachment to outcomes. You can love without possessing. This is radical freedom—the transparency of being fully yourself, fully seen, and fully at peace with the eternal cycle. From here, you return to Plenara, ready to begin again.`,
    guidance: "Let go completely. Teach by being. Lead by releasing control. Embrace the return."
